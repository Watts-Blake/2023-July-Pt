A graph is an abstract data type that represents a collection of nodes and edges.
Each node represents one or more values
Each edge represents the relationships between nodes.

Examples: street maps, social networks, internet, board games/video game decision trees

# Directed vs Undirect
- Directed Graph, the relationship goes one way. Example : Twitter or Instagram
- Undirected Graph, the relationship goes both ways. Example : Friends on Facebook.

# Cyclic vs Acyclic
- A recursive relationship on a graph.
- Trees cannot have cycles but graphs can.
- Undirected edges are also cycles.

# Weighted vs Unweighted
- Edges can have weight, for example traffic or length.
- Unweighted graphs all have edge weights of 1.
