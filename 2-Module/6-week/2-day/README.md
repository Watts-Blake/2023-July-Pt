A graph is an abstract data type that represents a collection of nodes and edges.
Each node represents one or more values and each edge represents a relation between those nodes.

Examples : Street Maps, Social Networks, Movie Recommendations, Game Decision Trees, the Internet.

# Directed vs Undirected
- Directed Graphs, the relationship goes one way. Example : Twitter or Instagram
- Undirected Graphs, the relationship goes both ways. Example : Friends on Facebook.

# Cyclic vs Acyclic
- A recursive relationship in the graph.
- Trees cannot have cycles but graphs can.
- Undirected Edges are also cycles.

# Weighted vs Unweighted
- Edges can have weight, for example traffic or length.
- Unweighted graphs all have a value of 1.
